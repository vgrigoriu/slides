# The 9 rules

- Understand the system
- Make it fail
- Quit thinking and look
- Divide and conquer
- Change one thing at a time
- Keep an audit trail
- Check the plug
- Get a fresh view
- If you didn't fix it, it ain't fixed

> You have to understand how things are supposed to work if you want to figure
> out why they don’t.

# Understand the system

## Asta vine în jos

# Debugging

- obvious, but not easy
- don’t take shortcuts
- debugging != troubleshooting

# The 9 rules

- Understand the system
- Make it fail
- Quit thinking and look
- Divide and conquer
- Change one thing at a time
- Keep an audit trail
- Check the plug
- Get a fresh view
- If you didn’t fix it, it ain’t fixed

# Understand the system

> You have to understand how things are supposed to work if you want to figure
> out why they don’t.

- read the manual (before things fail)
- read everything in depth
- know the fundamentals
- know the high level structure of the system
- understand your tools
- don’t guess, look it up

# Make it fail

- do it again
- start at th beginning
- stimulate the failure
- don't simulate the failure
- find the uncontrolled condition that makes it intermittent
- record everything and find the signature of intermittent bugs
- don't trust statistics too much
- know that “that” _can_ happen
- never throw away a debugging tool

# Quit thinking and look

# What is legacy code?

--
Code without tests.

# Reasons to change software

- Adding a feature
- Fixing a bug
- Improving the design (i.e. refactoring)
- Optimization
???
- try to keep the behavior the same (unless it's a bug)
- thin line between changing/adding behavior
- refactoring de dragul refactoringului e dubios

# Preserving behavior

# Risky changes

Ask three questions:
--

1. What changes do we have to make?
--

2. How will we know that we’ve done them correctly?
--

3. How will we know that we haven’t broken anything?

---
# Don't avoid change

- it gets worse
- you don't gain confidence with the system
- you live in fear

---
# How do we make changes?

- with a safety net
- automated regression tests
- unit tests give *quick* feedback
- higher level tests are also useful

---
# Dependencies in legacy code

.quote[
> Dependency is one of the most critical problems in software development. Much legacy code work
> involves breaking dependencies so that change can be easier.

# The Legacy Code Dilemma

The solution is conservative refactorings that break dependencies, e.g.
extract interface
